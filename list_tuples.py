#understanding list and tuples
#list and tuples act as array in python

a=[1,2,3,4,5.6] #list dec
print a

b=('taha','pipe','90','45') #tuple dec
print b

#list modification
a[2]=10  #3 will get replace d by 10
print a

#tuples modification this will give error as tuples cant be modified
#b[2]='wala'
#print b

#list slicing

print a[2:5] #print after 2nd element

#tuple slicing

print b[2:4] ##print after 2nd element
